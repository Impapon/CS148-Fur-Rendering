CS148 Summer 2014 Final Project
README file
Name: Tsao-Wei (Brad) Huang

Source Code included:
	Three pairs of shaders: furDemo, tigerFur and furKKShading. Each pair can be used together to 
		create the shading effect described in each file.
	main.cpp: blocks of the code are borrowed from HW4, while others have been separated out. The 
		drawing fur onto meshes part does not work well..

The program fur generated can be invoked by
./fur mesh_filename vertex_shader fragment_shader

If the fur program is made to draw a tile of fur, the mesh filename does not make any difference:
the program is just going to draw a tile of fur facing directly at the camera. Some user controls
should be used to orient the tile to reach fur-like viewing angles. The controls are:

	'l': increase the fur length
	'k': decrease the fur length
	'm': increase fur density
	'n': decrease fur density
	't': make fur thinner by sampling on a larger fur texture. Also increases fur density
	'y': opposite to 't'
	'-': scale down the objects
	'='/'+': scale up the objects
	Arrow keys: rotations
	Mouse: translations
